# Statistical Inference
# Week 1
# Exploring gapminder data

# Make syre you have the following packages installed:
# ggplot2
# dplyr
# scales
# gapminder

# Run the following code, which double-checks that you have the packages installed,
# and loads them into the R session.

if(!require(ggplot2)){install.packages("ggplot2")}
library(ggplot2)
if(!require(dplyr)){install.packages("dplyr")}
library(dplyr)
if(!require(scales)){install.packages("scales")}
library(scales)
if(!require(gapminder)){install.packages("gapminder")}
library(gapminder)

# The data for today is loaded automatically by the gapminder package
# Let's find out what variables are available, and what are their names? 
# The function str() is your friend here.

str(gapminder)

# Tech note: The gapminder data set was constructed as a tibble, a generalization of a data.frame.
# The default print() method gives an abbreviated printout. Normally, you would use head(gapminder) for this.

gapminder
head(gapminder)

# Normally, when starting with a new data set, it is useful to get some overview of the variables. 
# The simplest one is summary().

summary(gapminder)

# We will want to look at trends over time by continent. 
# How many countries are in this data set in each continent? 
# There are 12 years for each country. Are the data complete? table() gives an answer.

table(gapminder$continent, gapminder$year)

# Tech note: table() doesn’t have a data= argument, 
# so you have to qualify the names of variables using data$variable notation. 
# Another way to do this is to use the with() function, which makes variables in a data set available directly. 
# The same table can be obtained using:

with(gapminder, {table(continent, year)})


# Task 3

# Bar plots are often used to visualise the distribution of a discrete variable, like continent. 
# With ggplot2, this is relatively easy:
  
# map the x variable to continent
# add a geom_bar() layer, that counts the observations in each category and plots them as bar lengths.
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=continent)) + geom_bar()

# To make this (and other plots) more colourful, you can also map the fill attribute to continent.
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=continent, fill=continent)) + geom_bar()

# Time Series
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "United States") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, pop)) +
  geom_point()

# As a line graph instead
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "United States") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, pop)) +
  geom_line()


# Task 4

# Now let’s explore the relationship between life expectancy and GDP with a scatterplot, 
# which was the subject of Rosling’s TED talk. 
# (Actually, he did more than this, with a “moving bubble plot”,
# using a bubble symbol ~ population, and animating this over time.)

# A basic scatterplot is set up by assigning two variables to the x and y aesthetic attributes. 

# The following just creates an empty plot frame.
plt <- ggplot(data=gapminder,
              aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))
plt

# With points
plt+geom_point()

# Colour points by continent
plt + geom_point(aes(colour=continent))

# Try a log scale for GDP
plt + geom_point(aes(colour=continent))+scale_x_log10()

# Fit a straight line relationship
plt + geom_point(aes(colour=continent))+ scale_x_log10()+geom_smooth(method="lm")

# Note how it doesn't matter what order you add the features in
plt + geom_point(aes(colour=continent))+geom_smooth(method="lm")+ scale_x_log10()

# But if you want to transform to a log scale after fitting a straight line relationship,
# you need to use coordinate transformations
plt + geom_point(aes(colour=continent))+geom_smooth(method="lm")+ coord_trans(x ="log10")
# Having done this, the line of best fit doesn't look right
# so you can see that coordinate transformation / scaling can really affect your graphs
# you need to choose wisely, especially if you are then plotting lines of best fit!
# Maybe this is a better choice
plt + geom_point(aes(colour=continent))+geom_smooth(method="lm")+ scale_x_log10()+coord_trans(x = scales::exp_trans(10))
